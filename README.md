# YOLO Object Recognition

This project performs object detection and recognition using the pre-trained YOLO (You Only Look Once) model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Remarks

To use YOLO for object detection, you need to use a pre-trained YOLO model. The object recognition code using YOLO can be found in the folder:  
**`detection_using_YOLO_model/`**

### Steps to run the code:

1. Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights file from the following link:  
   [YOLOv3 weights](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)

2. Run the Python script for image detection:  
 ```bash
   python script_image_detection.py
```
