# YOLO_object_recognition
Objects detection and recognition using pre-trained YOLO (you only look once) model

## requirements
Python3.x <br/>
Opencv <br/>
numpy <br/>

## remark 
We should use a pre-trained Yolo (yolo you only live once) model for object detection <br/>
The code of object recognition using Yolo is in the folder : detection_using_YOLO_model/ <br/>
Run the code : <br/>
